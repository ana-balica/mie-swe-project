Semantic Web and Linked Data Project
====================================

### Execution steps

1. The description of the selected datasets can be found in `source/data.txt`.

  The idea is to create links between airports, countries, countries' GDP (Gross 
  domestic product) and tourism level in those countries using open data from 
  [worldbank](http://data.worldbank.org/) and [openflights](http://openflights.org).
2. To download the data run bash scripts from `download/downloader/*`. The resulting
  data is stored to `download/cache/*`.
